# starsector_firefly
Adding the 03-K64-Firefly to 0.95.1a-RC6 Starsector 

This mod includes a 'start as a Mal' smuggler option and the ship, itself.
The cargo size and speed is inspired by the pen-and-paper RPG stats. The firefly is faster than a civilian transport (the kite) and slower than a fighter (the picket). Some artistic license was taken to make it fun and not impossible. Fuel, armor, and hull integrity is all sort of in line with similar ships. 

I've made it a fuel efficient, fast, and agile ship with decent cargo space.

Though the serenity did not have weapon systems or shields, I think it's not unreasonable to assume that Jayne could have stick-welded a few on there. The pirates can do it, why couldn't he? Inara's shuttle is not included... but maybe I should add it for flavor.

This is just a basics settings mod, so there should be no bugs.

Cheers.
